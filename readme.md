The app provides lots of powerful extra actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS, iOS, and visionOS. These actions make it significantly easier to create shortcuts.

## Where is the source code?

The app is no longer open-source. Despite initial hopes for community collaboration, the project received minimal contributions while facing challenges with App Store clones. The effort required to maintain it as open-source outweighed the benefits.

Rest assured, the app remains free, actively developed, and committed to providing powerful Shortcuts actions through regular updates. I will continue using GitHub issues for action requests and bug reports.
